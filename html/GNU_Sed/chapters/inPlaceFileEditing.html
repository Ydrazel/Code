        In the examples presented in previous chapter, the output from <code>
        sed</code> was displayed on the terminal or redirected to another file.
        This chapter will discuss how to write back the changes to the input
        file(s) itself using the <code>-i</code> command line option. This option
        can be configured to make changes to the input file(s) with or without
        creating a backup of original contents. When backups are needed, the
        original filename can get a prefix or a suffix or both. And the backups
        can be placed in the same directory or some other directory as needed.
