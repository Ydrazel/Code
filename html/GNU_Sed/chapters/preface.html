          You are likely to be familiar with the "Find and Replace" dialog box 
          from a text editor, word processor, IDE, etc to search for something 
          and replace it with something else. <code>sed</code> is a command 
          line tool that is similar, but much more versatile and feature-rich.
          Some of the GUI applications may also support <b>regular expressions
          </b>, a feature which helps to precisely define a matching criteria.
          You could consider regular expressions as a mini-programming language
          in itself, designed to solve various text processing needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book heavily leans on examples to present options and features of
          <code>sed</code> one by one. Regular expressions will also be 
          discussed in detail. However, commands to manipulate data buffers and
          multiline techniques will be discussed only briefly and some commands
          are skipped entirely.

          It is recommended that you manually type each example and experiment
          with them. Understanding both the nature of sample input string and 
          the output produced is essedtial. As an analogy, consider learning to
          drive a bike or a car -- no matter how much you read about them or 
          listen to explanations, you need to practice a lot and infer your own
          conclusions. Should you feel that copy-paste is ideal for you, 
          <a href="https://github.com/">code snippets are available chapter
          wise on GitHub</a>.

          Prior experience working with command line and <code>bash</code> shell
          , should know concepts like file redirection, command pipeline and so 
          on. Knowing basics of <code>grep</code> will also help in 
          understanding filtering features of <code>sed</code>.

          My Command line text processing repository includes a chapter on 
          <code>GNU sed</code> which has been edited and expanded to create
          this book.

            The examples presented here have been tested on <code>GNU bash
            </code> shell with <b>GNU sed 4.8</b> and may include features not
            available in earlier versions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Code snippets shown are copy pasted from <code>bash</code> shell and
            modified for presentation purposes. Some commands are preceded by 
            comments to provide context and explanations. Blank lines to improve
            readability, only <code>real</code> time shown for speed comparisons
            , output skipped for commands like <code>wget</code> and so on.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unless otherwise noted, all examples and explanations are meant for
            <i>ASCII</i> characters only.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>sed</code> would mean <code>GNU Sed</code>, <code>grep</code>
            would mean <code>GNU grep</code> and so on unless otherwise 
            specified.
