      <i>Hyperlinks,</i> or simply <i>links,</i> connect (X)HTML pages and other
      resources on the Web. When you include a link on your page, you allow 
      visitors to travel from your page to another Web site, another page on your
      site, or even another location on the same page. Without external links, 
      a page stands alone, disconnected from the rest of the Web. With external
      links, that page becomes part of an almost boundless collection of information.
    </p>

    <h3><i>Basic Links</i></h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        To create a link, you need
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Web address</b> (called a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL)
          of the Web site or file you want to link. This usually starts with <code>
          http://</code>.</li>
          <li><b>Some text</b> in your Web page to label or describe the link.<br />
          Try to ensure that the text you use says something useful about the 
          resource being linked.</li>
          <li><b>An anchor element (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) with the <code>
          href</code> attribute</b> to bring it all together.<br />
          The element to create links is called an <i>anchor element</i> because
          you use it to anchor a URL to some text on your page. When users view
          your page in a browser, they can click the text to activate the link 
          and visit the page whose URL you specified in the link. You insert the
          full URL in the <code>href</code> attribute. This tells the link where
          it needs to go.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        You can think of the structure of a basic link as a cheeseburger (or your
        preferred vegan substitute). The URL is the cheese, the patty is the link
        text, and the anchor tags are the buns. Tasty, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have a Web page that describes HTML standards, you
        may want to refer Web surfers to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) --
        the organization that governs all things related to (X)HTML standards.
        A basic link to the W3C's Web site, <code>www.w3.org</code>, looks like
        this:
        <div class="code_example">
          <pre><code>
            &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/"&gt;World Wide Web 
            Consortium&lt;/a&gt; is the standards body that oversees the ongoing
            development of the XHTML specification.&lt;/p&gt;
          </code></pre>
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        You specify the link URL (<code>http://www.w3.org</code>) in the anchor
        element's <code>href</code> attribute. The text (<code>World Wide Web 
        Consortium</code>) between the anchor element's open and close tags
        (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>) labels or describes
        the link.
      </p>
      <p>Figure 6-1 shows how a browser displays this bit of markup.</p>
      <div class="browser">

          The <a href="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> is the

      <h4>Anchor elements aren't block elements</h4>
        Anchor elements are <i>inline elements</i> -- they apply to a few words
        or characters within a block of text (the text that you want to use as a
        link) instead of defining formatting for blocks of text. The anchor 
        element sits inside a paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) element. When
        you create a link, you should always create it within a block element,
        such as a paragraph, list item, heading, or even a table cell. Turn to
        Chapter 5 for more information on block elements.
      <p>
        Although many Web browsers can display your anchors just fine (even if 
        you don't nest them in block elements), some browsers don't handle this
        breach of (X)HTML syntax very well, such as
        <ul>
          <li>Text-only browsers for Palm devices and mobile phones</li>
          <li>Text-to-speech readers for the visually impaired</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Text-based browsers rely on block elements to properly divide the 
        setions of your page. Without a block element, these browsers might
        display your links in the wrong places.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      You can also anchor URLs to images so users can click an image to activate
      a link. (For more about creating images that link, see Chapter 7.)
    </p>
    <p>
      For a detailed discussion of the ins and outs of URLs, see Chapter 1.
    </p>

    <h4><i>Link options</i></h4>
    <p>
      You can link to a variety of online resources:
      <ul>
        <li>Other (X)HTML pages (either on your Web site or on another Web site)</li>
        <li>Different locations on the same (X)HTML page</li>
        <li>Resources that aren't even (X)HTML pages at all, such as e-mail 
        addresses, pictures, and text files</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Link locations, captions, and destinations have a big impact on link value.
      Chapter 3 covers best practices for using links in your site design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind of link you create is determined by where you link.
    </p>

    <p><b><i>Absolute links</i></b><br />
      An <i>absulute link</i> uses a complete URL to connect browsers to a Web
      page or online resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      Links that use a complete URL to point to a resource are called <i>absolute</i>
      because they provide a complete, standalone path to another Web resource.
      When link to a page on someone else's Web site, the Web browser needs every
      bit of information in the URL to find the page. The browser starts with 
      the domain in the URL and works its way through the path to a specific file.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you link to files on someone else's site, you must always use absolute
      URLs in the <code>href</code> attribute of the anchor element (for example,
      <code>http://www.website.com/directory/page.html</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Relative links</i></b><br />
      A <i>relative link</i> uses a kind of shorthand to specify the URL for the
      resource where you're pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the following guidelines with relative links in your (X)HTML pages:
      <ul>
        <li>You create relative links between resources in the same domain</li>
        <li>Because both resources are in the same domain, you can omit domain
        information from the URL.<br />
        A <i>relative</i> URL uses the location of the resource you're linking
        from to identify the location of the resource you're linking to (for
        example, <code>page.html</code>).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      A relative link is similar to telling someone that he or she needs to go to
      the Eastside Mall. If the person already knows where the Eastside Mall is,
      he or she doesn't need additional directions. Web browsers behave the same
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use relative links on your site, your links still work if you change
      either
      <ul>
        <li>Servers</li>
        <li>Domain names</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i><u>Simple links</u></i></b><br />
      You can take advantage of relative URLs when you create a link between 
      pages on the same Web site. If you want to make a link from <code>http://
      www.mysite.com/home.html</code> to <code>http://www.mysite.com/about.html
      </code>, you can use this simplified, relative URL in an anchor element on
      <code>home.html</code>:
      <div class="code_example">
        <pre><code>
          &lt;Learn more &lt;a href="about.html"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; our company.&lt;/p&gt;
        </code></pre>
      </div>
      When a browser sees a link without a domain name, the browser assumes the
      link is <i>relative</i> and uses the domain and path of the linking page 
      to find the linked page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><i><u>Site links</u></i></b><br />
      As your site grows more complex and you organize your files into a variety
      of folders, you can still use relative links. But you must provide additional
      information in the URL to help the browser find files that don't reside in
      the same directory as the file from which you're linking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use ../ (two periods and a slash) before the filename to indicate that the
      browser should move up one level in the directory structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The markup for this process looks like this:
      <div class="code_example">
        <pre><code>
          &lt;a href="../docs/home.html"&gt;Documentation home&lt;/a&gt;
        </code></pre>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      The notation in this anchor element instructs the browser to:
      <ol><b>
        <li>Move up one folder from the folder the linking document is stored in.</li>
        <li>Find a folder called <code>docs</code>.</li>
        <li>Find a file called <code>home.html</code>.</li>
      </b></ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create a relative link, the location of the file <i>to</i> which
      you link is always relative to the file from which you link. As you create
      your relative URL, trace the path a browser must take if it starts on the 
      page you're linking from before it can get to the page to which you're
      linking. That path defines the URL for your relative link.
    </p>

    <h4><i>Common Mistakes</i></h4>
    <p>
      Every Web resource, such as sites, pages, and images, has a unique URL.
      Even one incorrect letter in your URL can lead to a <i>broken link.</i>
      Broken links lead to an error page (often the HTTP error <code>404 File
      or directory not found</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      URLs are so finicky that a simple typo breaks a link.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a URL doesn't work, try these tactics:
      <li>
        <b>Check the capitalization.</b> Some Web servers (Linux and Unix most
        notably) are <i>case sensitive</i> (meaning they distinguish between 
        capital and lowercase letters). These servers treat the filenames <code>
        Bios.html</code> and <code>bios.html</code> as different files on the
        Web server. That also means that browsers must use uppercase and lowercase
        letters when necessary. Be sure the capitalization in the link matches
        the capitalization of the URL.<br />
        To avoid problems with files on your Web site, follow a standard naming
        convention. Often, using only lowercase letters can simplify your life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Check the extension.</b> <code>Bios.htm</code> and <code>Bios.html
        </code> are two different files. If your link's URL uses one extension
        but the actual filename uses another, your link won't work.<br />
        To avoid problems with extensions on your Web site, pick either <code>
        .html</code> or <code>.htm</code> and stick to that extension.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Check filename.</b> <code>bio.html</code> and <code>bios.html</code>
        are two different files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cut and paste.</b> Avoid retyping a URL if you can copy it. The best
        and most foolproof way to create a URL that works is
        <ol><b>
          <li>Load a page in your browser.</li>
          <li>Copy the URL from the browser's address or link text box</li>
          <li>Paste the URL into your (X)HTML markup.</li>
        </b></ol>
      </li>
    </p>

    <div class="column_2">
      <h4>The importance of http:// in (X)HTML links</h4>
      Browsers make surfing the Web as easy as possible. If you type <b>www.sun
      .com, sun.com</b>, or often even just <b>sun</b>, in your browser's address
      window, the browser obligingly brings up <code>http://www.sun.com</code>.
      Although this technique works when you type URLs into your browser window,
      it won't work when you're writing markup.
      <p>
        The URLs that you use in your HTML markup must be fully formed. Browsers
        won't interpret URLs that don't include the page protocol. If you forget
        the <code>http://</code>, your link won't work.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3><i>Customizing Links</i></h3>
    <div>
      You can customize links to
      <ul>
        <li>Open linked documents in new windows</li>
        <li>Link to specific locations <i>within</i> a Web page</li>
        <li>Link to items other than (X)HTML pages, such as
          <ul>
            <li>Portable Document Format (PDF) files</li>
            <li>Compressed files</li>
            <li>Word-processing documents</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>New windows</h4>
      The Web works because you can link pages on your Web site to pages on 
      other people's Web sites by using a simple anchor element. But when you
      link to someone else's site, you send users away from your own site.
      <p>
        To keep users on your site, HTML can open the linked page in a new window.
        The simple addition of the <code>target</code> attribute to an anchor
        element opens that link in a new browser window instead of opening it in
        the current window:
      </p>
      <div class="code_example">
        <pre><code>
          &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org" target="_blank"&gt;World 
          Wide Web consortium&lt;/a&gt; is the standards body that oversees the
          ongoing development of the XHTML specification.&lt;/p&gt;
        </code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        When you give a <code>target</code> attribute a <code>_blank</code> value,
        this tells the browser to
        <ol><b>
          <li>Keep the linking page open in the current window.</li>
          <li>Open the linked page in a new window.</li>
        </b></ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The result of the <code>target="_blank"</code> attribute is shown in 
        Figure 6-2.
      </p>
      <p>Pop-up windows irritate some users.</p>
      <p>
        You can use JavaScript to control the size and appearance of pop-up
        windows, as well as put buttons on them to help users close them quickly.
        Chapter 12 covers pop-up windows in more detail.
