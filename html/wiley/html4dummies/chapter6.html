      <i>Hyperlinks,</i> or simply <i>links,</i> connect (X)HTML pages and other
      resources on the Web. When you include a link on your page, you allow 
      visitors to travel from your page to another Web site, another page on your
      site, or even another location on the same page. Without external links, 
      a page stands alone, disconnected from the rest of the Web. With external
      links, that page becomes part of an almost boundless collection of information.
    </p>

    <h3><i>Basic Links</i></h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        To create a link, you need
        <ul>
          <li><b>The Web address</b> (called a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL)
          of the Web site or file you want to link. This usually starts with <code>
          http://</code>.</li>
          <li><b>Some text</b> in your Web page to label or describe the link.<br />
          Try to ensure that the text you use says something useful about the 
          resource being linked.</li>
          <li><b>An anchor element (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) with the <code>
          href</code> attribute</b> to bring it all together.<br />
          The element to create links is called an <i>anchor element</i> because
          you use it to anchor a URL to some text on your page. When users view
          your page in a browser, they can click the text to activate the link 
          and visit the page whose URL you specified in the link. You insert the
          full URL in the <code>href</code> attribute. This tells the link where
          it needs to go.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        You can think of the structure of a basic link as a cheeseburger (or your
        preferred vegan substitute). The URL is the cheese, the patty is the link
        text, and the anchor tags are the buns. Tasty, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you have a Web page that describes HTML standards, you
        may want to refer Web surfers to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) --
        the organization that governs all things related to (X)HTML standards.
        A basic link to the W3C's Web site, <code>www.w3.org</code>, looks like
        this:
        <div class="code_example">
          <pre><code>
            &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/"&gt;World Wide Web 
            Consortium&lt;/a&gt; is the standards body that oversees the ongoing
            development of the XHTML specification.&lt;/p&gt;
          </code></pre>
        </div>
      </p>
      <p>
        You specify the link URL (<code>http://www.w3.org</code>) in the anchor
        element's <code>href</code> attribute. The text (<code>World Wide Web 
        Consortium</code>) between the anchor element's open and close tags
        (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code>) labels or describes
        the link.
      </p>

          The <a href="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> is the
          standards body that oversees the ongoing development of the XHTML 
          specification.

      <h4>Anchor elements aren't block elements</h4>
        Anchor elements are <i>inline elements</i> -- they apply to a few words
        or characters within a block of text (the text that you want to use as a
        link) instead of defining formatting for blocks of text. The anchor 
        element sits inside a paragraph (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) element. When
        you create a link, you should always create it within a block element,
        such as a paragraph, list item, heading, or even a table cell. Turn to
        Chapter 5 for more information on block elements.
      <p>
        Although many Web browsers can display your anchors just fine (even if 
        you don't nest them in block elements), some browsers don't handle this
        breach of (X)HTML syntax very well, such as
        <ul>
          <li>Text-only browsers for Palm devices and mobile phones</li>
          <li>Text-to-speech readers for the visually impaired</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Text-based browsers rely on block elements to properly divide the 
        setions of your page. Without a block element, these browsers might
        display your links in the wrong places.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      You can also anchor URLs to images so users can click an image to activate
      a link. (For more about creating images that link, see Chapter 7.)
    </p>
    <p>
      For a detailed discussion of the ins and outs of URLs, see Chapter 1.
    </p>

    <h4><i>Link options</i></h4>
    <p>
      You can link to a variety of online resources:
      <ul>
        <li>Other (X)HTML pages (either on your Web site or on another Web site)</li>
        <li>Different locations on the same (X)HTML page</li>
        <li>Resources that aren't even (X)HTML pages at all, such as e-mail 
        addresses, pictures, and text files</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Link locations, captions, and destinations have a big impact on link value.
      Chapter 3 covers best practices for using links in your site design.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind of link you create is determined by where you link.
    </p>

    <p><b><i>Absolute links</i></b><br />
      An <i>absulute link</i> uses a complete URL to connect browsers to a Web
      page or online resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      Links that use a complete URL to point to a resource are called <i>absolute</i>
      because they provide a complete, standalone path to another Web resource.
      When link to a page on someone else's Web site, the Web browser needs every
      bit of information in the URL to find the page. The browser starts with 
      the domain in the URL and works its way through the path to a specific file.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you link to files on someone else's site, you must always use absolute
      URLs in the <code>href</code> attribute of the anchor element (for example,
      <code>http://www.website.com/directory/page.html</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Relative links</i></b><br />
      A <i>relative link</i> uses a kind of shorthand to specify the URL for the
      resource where you're pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the following guidelines with relative links in your (X)HTML pages:
      <ul>
        <li>You create relative links between resources in the same domain</li>
        <li>Because both resources are in the same domain, you can omit domain
        information from the URL.<br />
        A <i>relative</i> URL uses the location of the resource you're linking
        from to identify the location of the resource you're linking to (for
        example, <code>page.html</code>).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      A relative link is similar to telling someone that he or she needs to go to
      the Eastside Mall. If the person already knows where the Eastside Mall is,
      he or she doesn't need additional directions. Web browsers behave the same
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use relative links on your site, your links still work if you change
      either
      <ul>
        <li>Servers</li>
        <li>Domain names</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
