<p>
	Creating your very own Web page can seem a little daunting, but it's definitely fun, and our
	experience tells us the best way to get started is to jump right in with both feet. You might
	splash around a bit first, but you can keep your head above water without too much trashing.
</p>
<p>
	This chapter walks you through four simple steps to creating a Web page. We don't stop and
	explain every nuance of the markup you use -- we save that for other chapters. Instead, we
	want to make you comfortable working with markup and content to create and view a Web page.
</p>

<h3>Before You Get Started</h3>
<p>
	Creating HTML documents differs from creating word-processor documents in an application
	like Microsoft Word because you use two applications:
	<ul>
		<li>You create the Web pages in your text or HTML editor.</li>
		<li>You view the results in your Web browser.</li>
	</ul>
	Even though many HTML editors, such as Dreamweaver and HTML-Kit, provide a browser preview,
	it's still important to preview your Web pages inside actual Web browsers, such as Internet
	Explorer and Firefox, so you can see them as your end users will. It's a bit unwieldy to
	edit in one application and switch to another to look at your work, but you'll be 
	switching like a pro from text editor to browser and back in (almost) no time.
</p>
<p>
	To get started on your first Web page, you need two types of software:
	<ul>
		<li><b>A text editor such as Notepad, TextPad or SimpleText</b><br />
			Notepad is the native text editor in Windows. TextPad is a shareware text editor 
			available from <a href="https://www.textpad.com">www.textpad.com</a>. (TextPad
			is used to create most of the figures in this chapter.) SimpleText is the native
			text editor in the Macintosh operating system.
		</li>
		<li><b>A Web browser</b></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	We discuss these basic tools in more detail in Chapter 20. We recommend that you whip out
	your good ol' text editor to make your first page. Here are a couple of reasons why:
	<ul>
		<li>An advanced HTML editor, such as FrontPage or Dreamweaver, often <i>hides</i>
			your HTML from you. For your first page, you want to see your HTML in all of its
			(limited) glory.<br />
			You can make a smooth transition to a more advanced editor after you're a little
			more familiar with HTML markup, syntax and document structure.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Word processors</i> (such as Microsoft Word) usually store a lot of extra file
			information behind the scenes (for example, formatting instructions to display or
			print files). You can't see or change the extra information, but it interferes with
			your HTML.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Creating a Page from Scratch</h3>
<p>
	Using HTML to create a Web page from scratch involves four straightforward steps:
	<ol><b>
		<li>Plan your page design.</li>
		<li>Combine HTML and text in a text editor to make that design a reality.</li>
		<li>Save your page.</li>
		<li>View your page in a Web browser.</li>
	</b></ol>
	So break out your text editor and Web browser and roll up your sleeves.
</p>
<h4>Step 1: Planning a simple design</h4>
<p>
	We've discovered that a few minutes spent planning your general approach to a page at the
	outset of work makes the page-creation process much easier.
</p>
<p>
	You don't have to create a complicated diagram or elaborate graphical display in this step.
	Just jot down some ideas for <i>what you want on the page</i> and <i>how you want it
	arranged.</i>
</p>
<p>
	You don't even have to be at your desk to plan your simple design. Take a notepad and pencil
	outside and design in the sun, or scribble on a napkin while you're having lunch. Remember,
	this is supposed to be fun.
</p>
<p>
	The example in this chapter is our take on the traditional "Hello World" exercise used just
	about every existing programming language. That is, the first thing you learn when tackling
	a new programming language is how to display the phrase <code>Hello World</code> on screen.
	In our example, we create a short letter to the world instead, so the page is a bÄ±t more 
	substantial and gives you more text to work with.
</p>
<p>
	The basic design for the page includes four basic components:
	<ul>
		<li>A serviceable title: "Hello World"</li>
		<li>A few paragraphs explaining how the page's author plans to help the Earth meets its
		yearly quota of Znufengerbs</li>
		<li>A closing of "Sincerely"</li>
		<li>A signature</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Jot down some notes about the color scheme you want to use on the page. For effect, we 
	decided that our example page should have a black background and white text, and the title
	should be "Greetings From Your Future Znufengerb Minister."
</p>
<p>
	When you know what kind of information you want on the page, you can move on to Step 2 --
	writing the markup.
</p>
<h4>Step 2: Writing some HTML</h4>
<p>
	You have a couple of different options when you're ready to create your HTML. In the end,
	you'll probably use some combination of these:
	<ul>
		<li>If you already have some text that you just want to describe with HTML, save that
		text as a plain text file and add HTML markup around it.</li>
		<li>Start creating markup and add the content as you go.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Our example in this chapter starts with some text in Word document format. We saved the 
	content as a text file, opened the text file in our text editor, and added markup around
	the text.
</p>
<p>
	To save a Word file as a text document, choose File&rarr;Save As. In the dialog box that
	appears, choose Text Only (*.txt) from Save As Type drop-down list.

	<hr />
	<pre><code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
			"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
    &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;

      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Greetings From Your Future Znufengerb Minister&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;body bgcolor="black" text="white"&gt;

      &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It has come to our attention that Earth has fallen well short of producing its yearly
      quota of Znufengerbs. To help you improve your production and establish a plentiful 
      Znufengerb colony, I, Zog, the Minister of Agriculture of Grustland, will be arriving on your
      planet within the week along with my herd experts to take command of your Znufengerb
      enterprise.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Do not fear. I have the highest expectations for a smooth transition from your current
      production of the creatures you call cows to our beloved Znufengerbs. The future of the galaxy
      hinges on Earth's ability to meet its Znufengerb quota and I will do all in my power to make
      you the most productive source of Znufengerb in the universe.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I have studied your history extensively and feel that I am the best candidate for the
      position of Znufengerb in every home to bring you joy.
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;
        Zog, Minister of Agriculture
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
	</code></pre>
</p>
<hr />
<p>
	The HTML markup includes a collection of markup elements and attributes that describe the letter's contents:
	<ul>
		<li>The <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element defines the document as an HTML document.</li>
		<li>The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element creates a header section for the document.</li>
		<li>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element defines a document title that is displayed in the
			browser's title bar.<br />
			The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element is <i>inside</i> the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.</li>
		<li>The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element holds the text that appears in the browser
			window.<br />
			The <code>bgcolor</code> and <code>text</code> attributes work with the 
			<code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. These attributes set the background color to black and
			the text color to white. (These attributes are deprecated, but really easy to use.
			Chapter 8 and 9 how to achieve the same effects by using CSS, which is the recommended
			method.)
		</li>
		<li>The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element marks the <code>Hello World</code> text as a
		first-level heading.</li>
		<li>The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements identify each paragraph of the document.</li>
		<li>The <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> element adds a manual line break after <code>
			Sincerely.
		</code></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Don't worry about the ins and outs of how all these elements work. They are covered in detail
	in Chapters 4 and 5.
</p>
<p>
	After you create a complete HTML page (or the first chunk of it that you want to review), you
	must save it before you can see your work in a browser.
</p>
<h4>Step 3: Saving Your Page</h4>
<p>
  You use a text editor to create your HTML documents and a Web browser to view them, but before you
  can let your browser loose on your HTML page, you have to save the page. When you're just building
  a page, you should save a copy of it to your local hard drive and view it locally with your 
  browser.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Choosing a location and name for your file</i></b><br />
  When you save your file to your hard drive, keep the following in mind:
  <ul>
  	<li>You need to be able to find it again.<br />
  		Create a folder on your hard drive especially for your Web pages.Call it 
  		<code>Web Pages</code> or <code>HTML</code> (or any other name that makes
  		sense to you), and be sure you put it somewhere easy to find.</li>
  	<li>The name should make sense to you so you can identify file contents
  		without actually opening the file.</li>
  	<li>The name should work well in a Web browser.<br />
  		Don't use spaces in the name. Some operating systems -- most notably Unix
  		and Linux (the most popular Web-hosting operating systems around) -- don't
  		tolerate spaces in filenames.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
	<b><i>.htm or .html</i></b><br />
	You can actually choose from one of two suffixes for your pages: <code>.html</code>
	or <code>.htm</code>. (Our example filename, <code>zog_letter.html</code>, uses
	the <code>.html</code> suffix.)
</p>
<p>
	The shorter <code>.htm</code> is a relic from the 8.3 DOS days when filenames
	could only have eight characters followed by a three-character suffix that
	described the file's type. Today, operating systems can support long filenames
	and suffixes that are more than three letters long, so we suggest you stick 
	with <code>.html</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Web servers and Web browsers handle both <code>.htm</code> and <code>.html</code>
	equally well.<br />
	Stick with one filename option. <code>.html</code> and <code>.htm</code> files
	are treated the same by browsers and servers, but they're different suffixes,
	so they create different filenames. (The name <code>zog_letter.html</code> is
	different from <code>zog_letter.htm</code>.) This matters when you create <i>
	hyperlinks</i> (covered in Chapter 6).
</p>
<h4>Step 4: Viewing your page</h4>
<p>
	After you save a copy of your page, you're ready to view it in a Web browser.
	Follow these steps to view your Web page in Internet Explorer. (Steps may be
	different if you're using a different browser.)
	<ol><b>
		<li>If you haven't opened your browser, do that now.</li>
		<li>Choose File&rarr;Open and click the Browse button.</li>
		<li>Navigate your file system until you find your HTML file, and then select
		it so it appears in the File name area.</li>
		<li>Click the Open button, and click OK.</li>
	</b></ol>
</p>
<p>
	You aren't actually viewing this file on the Web yet; you're just viewing a 
	<i>copy</i> of it saved on your local hard drive. You can't give anyone the
	URL for this file yet, but you can edit and view the changes you make.
</p>

<h3>Editing an Existing Web Page</h3>
<p>
	Chances are you'll want to change one thing (at least) about your page after
	you view it in a Web browser for the first time. After all, you can't really
	see how the page is going to look when you're creating the markup, and you
	might decide that a first-level heading is too big or that you really <i>want
	</i> purple text on a green background.
</p>
<p>
	To make chages to the Web page you've created in a text editor and are viewing
	in a browser, repeat these steps until you're happy with the final appearance
	of your page:
	<ol><b>
		<li>Leave the browser window with the HTML page display open and go back to 
		the text editor.</li>
		<li>If the HTML page isn't open in the text editor, open it.</li>
		<li>Make your changes to the HTML and its content in the text editor.</li>
		<li>Save the changes.</li>
		<li>Move back to the Web browser and click the Refresh button.</li>
	</b></ol>
</p>
<p>
	If you keep the HTML file open in both the text editor and the browser while 
	you work, checking changes is a breeze. You can quickly save a change in the
	editor, flip to the browser and refresh, flip back to the editor to make more
	changes, flip back to the browser and refresh, and so on.
</p>
<p>
	In our example letter, we decided after our initial draft of the HTML page that
	we should add a date to letter.
</p>
<p>
	This approach to editing an HTML page applies only to pages saved <i>on your
	local hard drive.</i> If you want to edit a page that you have already stored
	on a Web server, you have to save a copy of the page to your hard drive, edit
	it, verify your changes, and then upload the file again to the server, as 
	discussed in the following section.
</p>

<h3>Posting Your Page Online</h3>
<p>
	After you're happy with your Web page, it's time to put it online. Chapter 3 
	includes a detailed discussion of what you need to do to put your page online,
	but to sum it up in a few quick steps:
	<ol>
		<b><li>Find a Web hosting provider to hold your Web pages.</li></b>
		<p>Your Web host might be a company Web server or space that you pay an
		Internet service provider (ISP) for. If you don't have a host yet, double
		check with the ISP you use for Internet access -- find out whether you get 
		some Web-server space along with your access. Regardless of where you find
		space, get details from the provider on where to move your site's files and
		what your URL will be.</p>
		<b><li>Use an FTP client or a Web browser to make a connection to your Web 
		server.</li></b>
		<p>Use the username and password, as speicified in the information from your
		hosting provider, to open an FTP session on the Web server.</p>
		<b><li>Copy the HTML file from your hard drive to the Web server.</li></b>
		<b><li>Use your Web browser to view the fle via the Internet.</li></b>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	For example, to host our letter online at <code>ftp.io.com/~natanya</code>, we
	used Internet Explorer to access the site and provided the appropriate name 
	and password, which you get from your ISP. A collection of folders and files
	appeared.
</p>
<p>
	We copied the file to the server with a simple drag-and-drop operation from 
	Windows Explorer to Internet Explorer. The URL for this page is <code>
	http://www.io.com/~natanya/zog_letter.html</code>, and the page is now served
	from the Web browser instead of from a local file system.
</p>
