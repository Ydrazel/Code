	<ul>
		<li>Planning your Web page</li>

<p>
	The overall design of your site is the <i>interface</i> (UI). When you design
	a good UI, you give users the tools to move through your site with minimum
	fuss. This chapter outlines standard Web site design principles for your HTML.
	These principles can ensure a usable and effective UI.
</p>
<p>
	The UI is the mechanism that gives a user access to the information on your
	Web site. Each UI is unique, but they're all made from the same components
	<i>(text,graphics and media files)</i>, and they're all held together with
	HTML.
</p>
<p>
	Visitors probably won't return to your site if it
	<ul>
		<li>Is hard to navigate</li>
		<li>Is cluttered with flashing text and rampant colors</li>
		<li>Doesn't help people find what they're looking for</li>
	</ul>
	You've created a solid UI if
	<ul>
		<li>Your site's navigation is intuitive.</li>
		<li>Images and media accent your design without overpowering it.</li>
		<li>You do all you can to help people find the information they want.</li>
	</ul>
	This chapter walks you through simple steps to design a Web site and your 
	basic Web page. (Other chapters explain every nuance of the markup.)
</p>

<h4>Planning Your Site</h4>
<p>
	An important first step in creating an effective UI for your site doesn't 
	have anything to do with markup, but has everything to do with planning.
	Before your site grows too large (or before you even build your site you 
	haven't started yet), carefully identify your site's exact purpose and goals.
	When you know your site's scope and goals, you can better create an interface
	that embodies them.
</p>
<p>
	Before designing your site, ask yourself these questions:
	<ul>
		<li>Why are you creating this site?</li>
		<li>What do you want to convey to users?</li>
		<li>Who is your target audience? For example,
			<ul>
				<li>What's the average age of your users?</li>
				<li>How well does your audience work with the Internet?</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li>How many pages do you need in your site?</li>
		<li>What type of hierarchy will you use to organize your pages? For 
		example, you can create your site so users go through it linearly, or
		you can allow them to jump around from topic to topic.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<hr />
<h4 align="center">Design Matters</h4>
<p>This chapter recommends good design principles, but it's up to you to choose
color schemes and the overall look and feel. What looks great to one person may
be ugly to someone else.</p>
<p>If you're building a site for your business, that site can provide the first
impression for potential customers or clients. The site should reflect your 
business style. If you run an architecture firm, for example, strong lines and
a clean look may be the best way to present your company image. If you run a flower
shop, your site may be a bit more organic and decorated (okay, <i>flowery</i>) to
remind visitors of what they can expect if they walk into your store.</p>
<p>If you're new to Web design or graphics and you need a site that marks your
business presence on the Web, consider getting help from a Web-design professional.
Use images, layouts, and manage the site yourself. Once established, the distinctive
and consistent look and feel of your site is easy to maintain.</p>
<p>Regardless of who designs your site, take the time to get a critique of it 
from peers, friends, family members, and anyone else who is willing to be honest
about how good (and even how bad) it looks. A negative-but-constructive critique
from someone who knows and respects you beats a "Gee, that's ugly" from someone
whose business you are trying to acquire.</p>
<hr />

<p>
	If you can answer these qusetions, you can better understand your site's 
	goals and needs. For example, an online store may have these goals:
	<ul>
		<li>Let visitors browse an online catalog and put items in a shopping
		cart.</li>
		<li>Provide visitors a way to purchase the items in their cart online.</li>
		<li>Help users make smart purchasing decisions.</li>
		<li>Ease merchandise returns and exchanges.</li>
		<li>Solicit feedback from users about products they want to see in the
		catalog or ways to make the site better.</li>
	</ul>
	This short list of goals also indicates the areas your site may include and
	the activities your site needs to support.
</p>
<p>
	Instead of having just a single area (such as a product catalog), your site
	might need some specialized areas, such as
	<ul>
		<li>Online catalog and shopping cart</li>
		<li>Buying guides or other information that can help users make better
		purchasing decisions</li>
		<li>A help-and-feedback section</li>
		<li>A set of tools to expedite returns and exchanges</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	When you establish the goals for your site, you can identify the elements 
	best suited for the site, such as
	<ul>
		<li>
		A navigation system that identifies the major areas of the site, 
		which helps users
			<ul>
				<li>Quickly identify what part they're in</li>
				<li>Move from one part of the site to others without getting lost</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			A set of standard design elements, such as buttons, page-title styles,
			and color specifications, to keep the users oriented as they move from
			page to page in the same site
		</li>
		<li>
			A standard display for items in the catalog, including product-related
			information, such as product images and descriptions, prices, and 
			availability information
		</li>
		<li>
			Well-designed forms that help users find products in the catalog,
			purchase the items in their shopping carts, request a refund or help
			returning an item, and submit comments to the site
		</li>
		<li>
			Long text pages that offer extensive information on purchasing options,
			product returns, and other helpful information -- but that are still
			easy to read and to navigate
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Your site's goals should dictate your site's
	<ul>
		<b><li>UI elements</b><br />
			When you add to an existing site, identify UI elements that
			<ul>
				<li>Meet the goals of the new section of the site</li>
				<li>Complement the overall site UI design</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<b><li>Design</li></b>
		<b><li>Organization</li></b>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Mapping Your Site</h4>
<p>
	It's easier to get where you're going if you know how to get there. Mapping your
	Web site can be a vital step in planning -- and later running -- the site. 
	This process involves two creative phases:
	<ul>
		<b><li>Creating a visual guide on paper or electronically that you can use
		to guide the development of your site</li></b>
		<b><li>Creating a visual guide on your Web site to help visitors find their
		way around</li></b>
	</ul>
	Both have their place in good UI design, so each gets its own section.
</p>
<p><b><i>Using a map for site development</i></b><br />
	When you use a site map during the development of a Web site -- even a Web 
	site that includes only a few pages -- you can identify
	<ul>
		<li>Pages that you need to build</li>
		<li>How pages relate to each other</li>
		<li>Navigation elements that you need</li>
	</ul>
	As a bonus, a map provides you with a <i>checklist</i> of pages.
</p>
<p>
	This map shows that the site has several main sections. Three of those sections
	-- home, practice exams, and study materials -- are each further divided into
	subsections. Each subsection page lists information and links that are pertinent
	to that particular subsection.
</p>
<p><b><i>Building the site one piece at a time</i></b><br />
	If you plan to build your Web site a page or section at a time, you can create a
	map of the final site and then decide which pages it makes the most sense to
	build first. When you have a good working idea of how your site will expand,
	you can plan for it during each stage. For example, suppose you create a site
	map for your company's Web site, and the site needs a Frequently Asked Questions
	section. If that section isn't quite finished when the site launches, disaster
	need not ensue -- provided someone planned ahead to accomodate new sections
	and built that capability into the site. Just leave out links to that section
	of the site when you launch it.
</p>
<p>
	When the book examples section is ready, you
	<ul>
		<li>Add the section to the site.</li>
		<li>Add a link to the main navigation elements.</li>
	</ul>
	If you know the resources are coming, you can create a navigation scheme that
	easily accomodates the book examples section when it's ready to add. Without
	a site map and a complete plan for the site, however, integrating new sections
	can suck up lots of time and effort.
</p>
<p>
	Don't create <i>under construction</i> sections that don't include much of 
	anything except the hint that something will appear someday. Users are disappointed
	if your site merely hints at information it doesn't really offer. Instead, consider
	using a small section of your homepage to highlight "coming soon" items so visitors
	know new information will be available later on.
</p>
<p><b><i>Using a map as a visual guide for your users</i></b><br />
	A site map can be a supplemental navigational tool that gives users a different
	way to find what they're looking for. A site map lays out all contents of your
	site so visitors can see all their options at once.
</p>
<p>
	People have many approaches to finding information. Give visitors as many options
	as you can (realistically) for navigating your site:
	<ul>
		<li>Some people like to be led.</li>
		<li>Some people like to rummage around.</li>
		<li>Some people like to see every possible option and choose one.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<i>Site maps grow as your site grows</i>. If your site is large and complex,
	your map may take several screens to display. When you surf the Web, massive
	sites such as <code>Microsoft.com,HP.com</code> and <code>Amazon.com</code> 
	don't offer site maps because maps of their sites would be huge and unwieldy.
	But smaller sites (such as <code>Symnatec.com</code>) use site maps effectively.
</p>
<p>
	You must decide whether a site map is a good navigation tool for your site.
	Here are some points to ponder as you make this decision:
	<ul>
		<li>A site map may be <i>unnecessary</i> if you have only a few pages.</li>
		<li>A site map may be the <i>best</i> choice if
			<ul>
				<li>Your site has several sections.</li>
				<li>You can't think of other ways to access your content.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h4>Building solid navigation</h4>
<p>
	The navigation you use on your site can make or break it. If visitors can't 
	find what they're looking for on your site, they'll probably leave and never
	come back. The type of navigation you use on your site depends on
	<ul>
		<b><li>
			How many pages are on your site</b><br />
			If you have only a few pages, your navigation might be a simple collection
			of links on the home page that helps users jump to each page.
		</li>
		<b><li>
			How you organize your pages</b><br />
			If your site has many pages organized into different sections, your home
			page might link only to those sections (not to each page).
		</li>
	</ul>
	For example, the <code>Dummies.com</code> site houses a large collection of 
	pages organized as a variety of sections; it would be impractical to link to
	all the pages in any navigation scheme. Also, the site includes articles on
	a wide variety of topics, as well as book information. The site could be organized
	into books and articles, but visitors are more likely to look for information on
	a specific subject, so the site is organized by topic.
</p>
<p>
	If you create a map to aid site development, it can also help you choose what
	kind of navigational tools to create for your site. Consider each page on the
	map in turn; list the links that each page must include. Normally, a pattern
	emerges that can help you identify the main navigation tools your site needs,
	as well as sub-navigation tools (such as links to subtopics on the pages).
</p>
<p>
	After you know what tools you need, you can begin to design a visual scheme
	for your UI. Do you want to use buttons across the top, buttons down the side,
	or both? Do you need a footer that links to copyright or privacy information?
</p>
<p>
	If you have sections within sections within sections, how can you best help people
	navigate through them? Answering questions like these is the route to a solid
	navigation system that helps users find their way around your site -- letting
	them focus on what they came for, not on how to get there.
</p>
<p>
	Whatever navigation scheme you devise, always give your visitors a way to get
	back to your home page from wherever they are on the site. Your site's home 
	page is the gateway to the rest of the site. If visitors get lost or want to
	start again, make sure they can get back to Square One with no trouble.
</p>
<p>
	After you design your site's navigation scheme and put together a few pages,
	ask someone who isn't familiar with your site to try to use it. To help them
	with their testing, give them a list of three or four tasks you'd like them
	to complete -- pages to visit or a form to fill out, for example. If your test
	visitor gets lost or has lots of questions about how to navigate the site, you
	should rework your scheme. Your reviewer might also have suggestions on ways 
	to make navigation features clearer and easier to use. You might know your site
	and its content <i>too well</i> to spot gaps in navigation that a first-time
	user will probably discover immediately.
</p>

<h4>Planning outside links</h4>
<p>
	The Web wouldn't be the Web without hyperlinks -- after all, hyperlinks connect
	your site to the rest of the Web and turn a collection of pages into a cohesive
	site. But overusing or misusing links can detract from your site and even lose
	you some business.
</p>
<p><b><i>Choose your off-site links wisely</i></b><br />
	Internal linking is almost a walk in the park compared to external linking --
	after all, when you link to pages on your own site, the pages those links point
	to are <i>under your control.</i> You know what's on them today and what will
	be on them tomorrow, and even whether they will exist tomorrow. When you link
	to resources on someone else's site, however, all bets are off:
	<ul>
		<li>You don't maintain those pages.</li>
		<li>You can't modify their content.</li>
		<li>You certainly won't know when they will disappear.<br />
			Neither will your visitors -- until they slam into a <code>404 File or
			directory not found</code> message (the usual sign of a <i>broken link</i>
			that now goes nowhere). The text in 404 messages varies depending on the
			server hosting the Web site.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Links to other sites are more useful when they're stable and have less chance
	of breaking. We recommend these guidelines:
	<ul>
		<b><li>Link to a section of a site, not to a specific page on the site</b><br />
			Pages come and go, but the general organization usually stays the same.
		</li>
		<b><li>Link to corporate Web sites.</b><br />
			Corporate sites have more staying power than sites maintained by an individual.
		</li>
		<b><li>Don't link directly to media files such as PDF's and images.</b><br />
			If you want to link to resources on another Web site, link to the Web page
			that links to the resources instead of the actual media files. Sites often
			update the resources and give them new names. The page that links to the 
			resource, hovewer, is almost always certain to be updated to reflect new
			names. Therefore, the page is a safer linking bet.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Linking to other sites <i>implies your support or endorsement of those sites.</i>
	When visitors follow links from your site to other sites, they assume you approve
	of that new site. That makes a couple of guidelines necessary:
	<ul>
		<b><li>If you don't want to be associated with content on another site, don't
		link to the site.</b><br />
			The only way to find out whether you approve of a seemingly relevant site
			is to visit it and check it out <i>before</i> you link.
		</li>
		<b><li>Periodically review your links.</b> Be sure that<br />
			<ul>
				<li>The site's owners are the same.</li>
				<li>The content is appropriate.</li>
			</ul>
			When domain names expire, new owners may take them over and post new content
			that's either
			<ul>
				<li>Completely irrelevant</li>
				<li>Damaging to your image, such as with pornography</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><b><i>Craft useful link text</i></b><br />
	The text you associate with links is as important as the links you use on your
	site. That text gives users a hint about where the link takes them so they can
	decide whether to go along for the ride. For example, <code>Visit Dummies.com
	to read more about this book</code> is more helpful than <code>Read more about
	this book.</code>
</p>
<p>
	The first example tells visitors that they're going to leave the current site
	to visit <code>Dummies.com</code> and read more about a book there. The second
	just tells them they're going to read more about the book -- and they may be
	surprised to find themselves flung off one site and onto another.
</p>
<p>
	Generally, when you create link text, let users know the following:
	<ul>
		<b><li>Whether they're leaving your site</li></b>
		<b><li>What kind of information the page they're linking to contains</li></b>
		<b><li>How the linked site relates to the current content or page</li></b>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The goal of your link text should be to inform users and build their trust. If
	your link text doesn't give them solid clues about what to expect from your
	links, they just won't trust your links -- and won't follow them.
</p>
<p>
	Avoid the use of <i>click here</i> in any link you create. If your link text
	is well-crafted, you don't need the extra words to prompt the user to click a
	link. The link text should speak for itself.
</p>

<h3>Hosting Your Web Site</h3>
<p>
	The first (and most important) step in putting your pages online is finding
	someplace on the Web to put them on display -- a host. In general, you have
	two choices for hosting your pages:
	<ul>
		<li>Host them yourself.</li>
		<li>Pay someone else to host them.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The word <i>host</i> is used in the Web industry to mean a Web server set up
	to hold Web pages (and related files) so they can be accessed by the rest of
	the world. This chapter uses <i>host</i> as both
	<ul>
		<b><li>Noun:</b> The physical machine that holds the Web pages</li>
		<b><li>Verb:</b> The act of serving up the Web pages</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	You need to decide whether to host your own pages or to pay someone else a fee
	to host them for you. This chapter shows both approaches to hosting -- and gives
	you the skinny on each. You can decide which option is best for you.
</p>
<p>
	You aren't stuck with your hosting decision for life. If you find hosting your
	own pages overwhelming, you can move your files to a service provider (or vice
	versa). To decide which hosting option is best for you, consider your needs for
	the next year, but plan to review your needs in a few months.
</p>

<h4>Hosting your own Web site</h4>
<p>
	This section illustrates an average-sized site (up to about 100 pages) that
	doesn't include more than a couple of multimedia files and doesn't have any
	special security or electronic commerce (e-commerce) applications.
</p>
<p>
	If you need to run a complex site, such as a large corporate site or an
	online store, you need more expertise, equipment, and software than this
	section outlines. The following resources can help:
	<ul>
		<li>Books such as <i>E-Commerce For Dummies</i> and <i>Webmastering For
		 Dummies,</i> 2nd Edition (both from Wiley Publishing) can get you started
		setting up e-commerce and other complex sites.</li>
		<li>Consult a Web professional who has practical experience building and
		maintaining complex Web sites.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	You can set up your own Web server and host your Web pages yourself. To do 
	this, you need:
	<ul>
		<b><li>A computer designated as your Web server:</b>
			Web servers are often <i>dedicated</i> to this task, leaving word-processing
			and other activities to a different computer.
		</li>
		<b><li>Web-server software:</b>
			Common Web-server software packages include Apache and Microsoft's Internet
			Information Server (IIS), called Internet Information Services in Windows
			2000 and later.<br />
			In the Web world, the term <i>Web server</i> refers to both
			<ul>
				<li>A dedicated computer (the actual hardware)</li>
				<li>Web-server software</li>
			</ul>
			You can't use one without the other.
		</li>
		<b><li>A dedicated Internet connection:</b>
			Your Web server isn't usefulor reliable if it's connected to the Internet
			only when you fire up a dialup connection.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	If hosting a Web site yourself sounds a little complicated and expensive,
	you're right. Not only do you have to pay for the equipment and dedicated
	Internet connection, but you also must know how to set up and administer a
	Web server and keep all the pieces working 24/7. Consider using a hosting
	provider.
</p>

<h4>Using a hosting provider</h4>
<p>
	A hosting provider manages all the tehnical aspects of Web hosting, from hardware
	to software to Internet connections. You just manage your HTML pages. Back when
	the Web was young, hosting provider options were scarce, and what <i>was</i>
	available was expensive. The times have changed, and needs have grown, so 
	reasonably priced hosting providers are abundant these days.
</p>
<p>
	If you decide to let someone else host your pages, you have two choices for 
	how much you pay:
	<ul>
		<b><li>Nothing:</b> Some services actually host your pages for free. That's
			it; you pay zip, zero, nada to get your pages on the Web. What's the 
			catch? You must pay in other ways, usually with advertising attached to
			your page.
		</li>
		<b><li>Something:</b> Most Web-hosting services, however, charge you a fee,
			from a few dollars a month to triple digits a month. The trick to making
			the most of your hosting funds is to find just the right hosting service
			to meet your Web site needs.
		</li>
	</ul>
	read more about inexpensive Web hosting options in the Webmonkey article "Web
	Hosting for Under Ten Bucks."<br />
	<code>http://webmonkey.wired.com/webmonkey/02/01/index4a.html?tw=design</code>
</p>

<h4>Getting your own domain</h4>
<p>
	A <i>domain name</i> is the high-level address for any given Web site. Examples
	of domain names are <code>microsoft.com, apple.com, w3c.org</code>, and <code>
	dummies.com</code>.
</p>
<p>
	You might want your own domain name (hence your own domain) that reflects your
	business name (or even your personality). If you don't get a domain name of
	your own, your pages will be part of someone else's domain name -- usually
	your hosting provider's domain name. For example, a personal Web site hosted
	without a domain name at <code>io.com</code> has a top-level URL of<br />
	<code>http://www.io.com/~lanw</code><br />
	With a domain name of <code>lanw.com</code>, the same Web site would be hosted
	at<br />
	<code>http://www.lanw.com</code>
</p>
<p>
	One's easier to remember than the other. Is that a good enough reason to have
	your own domain? Maybe ... maybe not. The bottom line is that businesses or 
	other entities that want to maintain a constant Web presence should probably
	invest in a domain name; hobbyists or enthusiasts don't need one.
</p>
<p>
	Any good hosting provider can give you detailed instructions on how to register
	a domain name in the provider's system or attach your domain name to your Web
	site on its computers. If you're changing from one hosting provider to another,
	your new provider should help you transfer your domain. Most providers either
	give you this information up front or have online help that will walk you 
	through it. If it isn't immediately clear how to set up your domain, ask for 
	help. If you don't get it, change providers.
</p>

<h4>Moving files to your Web server</h4>
<p>
	After you secure a Web site host or decide to put up your own Web server, you
	need a way to move the HTML pages you create on your local computer to the Web
	server. This isn't a one-time activity either. As your maintain your Web site,
	you need to move files you've built on your local computer to the Web server 
	to refresh site.
</p>
<p>
	How you move files to your Web server depends entirely on how your Web server
	is set up. Normally, you have a couple of transfer options:
	<ul>
		<b><li>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</li></b>
		<b><li>A Web interface, provided by your hosting provider, for moving and
		managing files</li></b>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><b><i>Via FTP</i></b><br />
	Of these two options, FTP is almost always a possibility. FTP is the standard
	for transferring files on the Internet, and any hosting provider should give
	you FTP access to your Web server. When you set up your Web site with your
	hosting provider, the provider usually gives you written documentation (either
	on paper on on the Web) that tells you exactly how to transfer files to your
	Web server. Included in that information is an FTP URL that usually takes the
	form <code>ftp://ftp.<i>domain</i>.com</code>.
</p>
<p>
	You can use an FTP client such as WS_FTP (<code>www.ipswitch.com/Products/
	WS_FTP/</code>) or CuteFTP (<code>www.globalscape.com/products/cuteftp/
	index.asp</code>) to open a connection to this URL. Your provider will give
	you a username and password to use to access your Web-server directory on the
	FTP site. Then you can move files to your Web site using the client's interface.
	It's really that easy. If you want to grab a copy of a file from your Web site
	and modify it, you just
	<ul>
		<b><li>Use the FTP client's interface to download a copy.</li></b>
		<b><li>Make your modification.</li></b>
		<b><li>Use the FTP client's interface to upload the file.</li></b>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Each FTP cient's interface is different, but they're all pretty straightforward.
	Chapter 20 includes more information on finding a good FTP client; so when you
	find one, spend a few minutes reading its documentation.
</p>
<p>
	You might not need a seperate FTP client to move your files to your Web server:
	<ul>
		<li>Most newer Web browsers, such as current version of Internet Explorer
		and Netscape 6, have some FTP capabilities built in. You can easily upload
		and download files. (You might not be able to make or delete directories.)
		</li>
		<li>Many Web utilities, such as Dreamweaver, have file-management capabilities.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p><b><i>Via your hosting provider's Web site</i></b><br />
	In the interest of usability and reducing technical support calls, many Web
	hosting providers have built Web pages that help you upload and manage your
	Web site files without using a seperate FTP utility or even the FTP tools inside
	HTML editors. Most of these tools let you manage your site in various ways,
	such as
	<ul>
		<li>Uploading and downloading files</li>
		<li>Creating and deleting directories</li>
		<li>Moving files around</li>
		<li>Deleting files</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	If you already have a hosting provider, find out whether it has a set of Web-
	based tools for managing your site.<br />
	Keep the following in mind while you decide on a provider:
	<ul>
		<li>Read the provider's documentation before you start to transfer your files.
		Every provider's interface is different.</li>
		<li>Most providers who have Web interfaces won't stop you from managing your
		site with FTP.<br />
		Use FTP if the provider's interface is cumbersome or if you prefer FTP.
		</li>
	</ul>
