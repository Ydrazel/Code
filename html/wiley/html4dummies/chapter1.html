  <h2>Part1</h2>
  <h1>Getting to Know (X)HTML</h1>
  <p>In this part of the book, we explore and explain basic HTML document
    links and structures. We also explain the key role that Web browsers play
    in delivering all this stuff to people's desktops. We even explain where
    the (X) comes from - namely, a rewoking of the original description of
    HTML markup using XML syntax to create XHTML - and go on to help you
    understand what makes XHTML different (and possibly better, according to some)
    than plain old HTML. We also take a look at Web page anatomy and look at
    the various pieces and parts that make up a Web page.
  </p>
  <p>Next, we take you through the exercise of creating and viewing a simple
    Web page so you can understand what's involved in doing this for yourself.
    We also explain what's involved in making changes to an existing Web page
    and how to post your changes (or a new page) online.
  </p>
  <p>This part concludes with a rousing exhortation to figure out what you're
    doing before making too much markup happen. Just as a well-built house starts
    with a set of blue-prints and architectural drawings, so sholid a Web page
    (and site) start with a plan or a map, with some idea of where your pages
    will reside in cyberspace and how hordes of users can find their way to them.

  <h1 align="center">The Least You Need to Know about HTML and the Web</h1>
  <h4>In This Chapter</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating HTML in text files</li>
    <li>Serving and browsing Web pages</li>
    <li>Understanding links and URLs</li>
    <li>Understanding basic HTML syntax</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of the Web and HTML. With just a little
    bit of knowledge, some practice, and something to say, you can either
    build your own little piece of cyberspace or expand on work you've already
    done.
  </p>
  <p>This book is your down-and-dirty guide to putting together your first Web
    page, sprucing up an existing Web page, or creating complex and exciting
    pages that integrate intricate designs, multimedia, and scripting.
  </p>
  <p>The best way to start working with HTML is to jump right in, so that's
    what this chapter does: It brings you up to speed on the basics of how
    HTML works behind scenes of Web pages, introducing you to HTML's building
    blocks. When you're done with this chapter, you'll know how HTML works so
    you can start creating Web pages right away.
  </p>
  <h4>Web Pages in Their Natural Habitat</h4>
  <p>Web pages can contain many kinds of content, such as text, graphics,
    forms, audio and video files, and interactive games.
  </p>
  <p>Browse the Web for just a little while and you see a buffet of information
    and content displayed in many ways. Every Web site is different, but most
    have one thing in common: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
  </p>
  <p>Whatever information a Web page contains, every Web page is created
    in HTML (or some reasonable facsimile). HTML is the mortar that holds a Web
    page together; the graphics, content, and other information are the bricks.
  </p>
  <p>HTML files that produce Web pages are just text documents. That's why
    the Web works as well as it does. Text is the universal language of computers.
    Any text file that you create on a Windows computer, including an HTML file,
    works equally well on any other operating system.
  </p>
  <p>But Web pages aren't merely text documents. They're made with a special,
    attention-deprived, sugar-loaded text called HTML. HTML is a collection of
    instructions that you include along with pointers to your content in a text
    file that specifies how your page should look and behave.
  </p>
  <p>Stick with us to discover all the details you need to know about HTML!
  </p>
  <h4>Hypertext</h4>
  <p>Special instructions in HTML permit text to point (link) to something else.
    Such pointers are called hyperlinks. Hyperlinks are the glue that holds the 
    World Wide Web together. In your browser, hyperlinks usually appear in blue
    and are underlined. When you click one, it takes you somewhere else.
  </p>
  <p>Hypertext or not, a Web page is a text file. You can create and edit a Web
    page in any application that creates plain text (such as Notepad). When you're
    getting started with HTML, a text editor is the best tool to use. Just break
    out Notepad and you're ready to go. Some software tools have fancy options and
    applications (covered in Chapter 20) to help you create Web pages, but they
    generate the same text files that you create with plain-text editors.
  </p>
  <p>The World Wide Web comes by its name honestly. It's quite literally a web of
    pages hosted on Web servers around the world, connected millions of ways.
    Those connections are made by hyperlinks that connect one page to another.
    Without such links, the Web is just a bunch of standalone pages.
  </p>
  <p>Much of the Web's value comes from its ability to link to pages and other
    resources (such as images, downloadable files, and media presentations) on
    either the same Web site or at another site. For example, FirstGov 
    (www.firstgov.gov) is a gateway Web site - its sole function is to provide
    access to other Web sites. If you aren't sure which government agency handles
    first-time loans for homebuyers, or if want to know how to arrange a tour of
    the Capitol, visit this site (shown in Figure 1-1) to find out.
  </p>
  <h4>Markup</h4>
  <p>Web browsers were created specifically for the purpose of reading instructions
    (known as markup) and displaying the resulting Web page.
  </p>
  <p>Markup lives in a text file (with your content) to give orders to a browser.
  </p>
  <p>For example, look at the page shown in Figure 1-2. You can see how the page
    is made up and how it is formatted by examining its underlying HTML.
  </p>
  <p>This page includes an image, a heading that describes the page, a paragraph
    of text about red wine, and a list of common grape varietals.
  </p>
  <p>However, different components of the page use different formatting:
    <ul>
      <li>The heading at the top of the page is larger than hte text in the 
        paragraph.
      </li>
      <li>The items in the list have bullet points (big dots) before them.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The browser knows to display these components of the page in specific ways
  thanks to the HTML markup, shown in Listing 1-1.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Listing 1-1: Sample HTML Markup</p>
      <p><pre><code>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html
        PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional //EN' 'http://www.w3.org./TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd'&gt;
      &lt;html xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'&gt;
      
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Wine Varietals&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;&lt;img src='red_grapes.jpg' width="75" height="100" alt="Red Grapes" align="middle" hspace="5" /&gt;
          Understanding Red Wine Varietals
        &lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Altough wines tend to be generically categorized as
          either "white" or "red," in reality, there is a
          collection of wine varietals each with its own
          distinguishing characteristics. The red category
          includes a robust collection of over 20 varietals,
          including:
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Barbera&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Brunello&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Cabernet Franc&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Cabernet Sauvignon&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Carignan&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Carmenere&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Charbono&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Dolcetto&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Gamay&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Grenache&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Malbrec&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Merlot&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Mourvedre&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Nebbiolo&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Petite Sirah&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Pinot Noir&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Sangiovese&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Syrah&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Tempranillo&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Zinfandel&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      
      &lt;/html&gt;
      </code></pre></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Any text enclosed between less-than and greater-than signs (< >) is an HTML tag (often called the <i>markup</i>).
  For example, a <code>p</code> within brackets (&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; tags) identifies the text about red varietals as
  a paragraph; the <code>li</code> (&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt; tags) markup identifies each item in a list of varietals.
  That's really all there is to it. You embed the markup in a text file, along with text for readers to view, to let the
  browser know how to display your Web page.</p>
  <p>Tags and content between and within the tags are collectively called <i>elements</i>.</p>
  <h4>Browsers</h4>
  <p>The user's piece in the Web puzzle is a Web browser. Web browsers read instructions written in HTML and use those
    instructions to display a Web page's content on your screen.
  </p>
  <p>You should always write your HTML with the idea that people will view the content using a Web browser. Just remember
    that there's more than one kind of browser out there, and each one comes in several versions.
  </p>
  <p>Usually, Web browsers request and display Web pages available via the Internet from a Web server. You can also display
    HTML pages you've saved on your own computer before making them available on a Web server on the Internet. When
    you're developing your own HTML pages, you view these pages (called <i>local</i> pages) in your browser. You can use
    local pages to get a good idea of what people see after the page goes live on the Internet.
  </p>
  <p><i>Each Web browser interprets HTML in its own way.</i> The same HTML doesn't look exactly the same from one browser
    to the next. When you work with basic HTML, variances aren't significant, but as you integrate other elements
    (such as scripting and multimedia), rendering the markup can get hairy.
  </p>
  <p>Chapter 2 shows how to use a Web browser to view a local copy of your first Web page.</p>
  <p>Some people use text-only Web browsers, such as Lynx, because either</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They're visually impaired and can't use a graphical display.</li>
    <li>They like a lean, fast Web browser tht displays only text.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Web Servers</h4>
  <p>
    Your HTML pages aren't much good if you can't share them with the world. Web servers make that possible. A <i>Web server</i>
    is a computer that
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Connects to the Internet</li>
    <li>Runs Web server software</li>
    <li>Responds to requests from Web browsers for Web pages</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Almost any computer can be a Web server, including your home computer. But Web servers generally are computers
    dedicated to the task. You don't need to be an Internet or computer guru to publish your Web pages, but you must find
    a Web server to serve your pages:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you're bulding pages for a company Web site, your IT department may have a Web server. (Ask your IT guru for
      information.)
    </li>
    <li><p>If you're starting a new site, you need a host for your pages</p>
        <p>Finding an inexpensive host is easy. Chapter 3 shows how to determine your hosting needs and find the perfect
          provider.
        </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Anatomy of a URL</h4>
  <p>
    The Web is made up of millions of resources, each of them linkable. A resource's exact location is the key
    to linking to it. Without an exact adress (a <i>Uniform Resource Locator,</i> or <i>URL</i>), you can't see
    the Adress bar in a Web browser to visit a Web page directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    URLs are the standard adressing system for resources on the Web. Each resource (Web page, site, or individual file)
    has a unique URL. URLs work a lot like your postal adress.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each URL component helps define the location of a Web page or resource:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><b>Protocol:</b> Specifies the protocol the browser follows to request the file</p>
      <p>The Web page protocol is <code>http://</code> (the usual start to most URLs).</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Domain:</b> Points to the general Web site (such as <code>www.sun.com</code>) where the file resides.
     A domain may host a few files (like a personal Web site) or millions of files (like a corporate site,
    such as <code>www.sun.com</code>).</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Path:</b> Names the sequence of folders through which you must navigate to get to a specific file.</p>
      <p>For example, to get to a file in the <code>evangcentral</code> folder that resides in the <code>
        developers</code> folder, you use the <code>/developers/evangcentral/</code> path.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Filename:</b> Specifies which file in the directory path the browser accesses.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>(X)HTML's Components Parts</h4>
  <p>
     The following section removes the mystery from the <i>X.</i> This section shows
     <ul>
       <li>The differences between HTML and XHTML</li>
       <li>How HTML is written (its <i>syntax)</i></li>
       <li>Rules that govern its use</li>
       <li>Names for important pieces and parts of HTML (and XHTML) markup</li>
       <li>How to make the best, most correct use of its capabilities</li>
     </ul>
     <p>
       <h4>HTML and XHTML: What's the difference?</h4>
       <p>
         HTML is <i>Hypertext Markup Language,</i> a notation developed in the late
         1980s and early 1990s for describing Web pages. HTML is now enshrined in
         numerous standart descriptions (<i>specifications</i>) from the World Wide Web
         Consortium (W3C). The last HTML specification was finalized in 1999.
        </p>
      </p>
  </p>
  <h4 align=center>HTML and XHTML specifications</h4>
  <p>
    The formal documents to describe HTML and XHTML are on the W3C's Web site at
    <code>www.w3.org</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Markup languages usually include version numbers to identify them. The current 
    version of HTML is 4.01. It dates back to December 1997; you can find the
    document at <code>www.w3.org/TR/html4</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    XHTML has gone through two major drafts, 1.0 and 1.1. The 1.1 version is more 
    advanced than 1.0, but most Web content developers and software tools follow the 1.0
    specification. An XHTML 2.0 specification is in "Working Draft" status (its authors haven't
    finalized its content and structure). When a W3C specification is finished,
    it's known as a <i>W3C Recommendation.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can find specifications for all three versions of XHTML:
    <dl>
      <dt>XHTML 2.0 Working Draft (7/4/2004)</dt>
      <dd><code>www.w3.org/TR/2004/WD-xhtml2-20040722/</code></dd>
      <dt>XHTML 1.1 Module-based XHTML Recommendation (5/31/2001)</dt>
      <dd><code>www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/</code></dd>
      <dt>XHTML 1.0 Recommendation (1/26/2000)</dt>
      <dd><code>www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/</code></dd>
    </dl>
  </p>
  <p>
    Reading W3C specifications takes some learning and improves with repeated
    exposure. Don't let the formal language and notation of these documents put
    you off: After you understand what's up, you appreciate the precision and
    detail! But you may decide never even to look at one of these specifications
    -- it's entirely up to you!
  </p>
  <p>
    The HTML 4.01 specification is the rulebook of HTML, as the XHTML 1.0 specification
    is for XHTML -- each one tells you exactly which elements you can use, which
    attributes go with those elements, and how you use elements in combinations to
    create such page structures as lists, forms, tables and frames. This book
    uses the XHTML 1.0 specification as its basis.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you put an X in front of HTML to get <i>XHTML,</i> you get a new, improved version
    of HTML based on the <i>eXtensible Markup Language (XML).</i> XML ls designed to work and
    behave well with computers, software and the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    The original formulation of HTML has some irregularities that can cause heartburn for
    software that reads HTML documents. XHTML, on the other hand, uses an extremely regular
    and predictable syntax that's easier for software to handle. XHTML will replace HTML
    someday, but HTML keeps on ticking. This book covers both varieties and shows you the
    steps to put the X in front of your own HTML documents and turn them into XHTML.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Most HTML and XHTML markup is identical.</li>
      <li>In a few cases, HTML and XHTML markup looks a little different.</li>
      <li>In a few cases, HTML and XHTML markup must be used differently.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>This book shows how to create code that works in both HTML and XHTML.</p>
  <h4>Syntax and rules</h4>
  <p>
    HTML is a straightforward language for describing Web page contents. XHTML is even less
    demanding. Their components are easy to use -- when you know how to use a little bit of
    (X)HTML. Both HTML and XHTML markup have three types of components:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Elements:</b> Identifiy different parts of an HTML page by using tags</li>
      <li><b>Attributes:</b> Information about an instance of an element</li>
      <li><b>Entities:</b> Non-ASCII text characters, such as copyright symbols and accented
      letters</li>
    </ul>
    Every bit of HTML and /or XHTML markup that describes a Web page's content includes some
    combination of elements, attributes and entities.
  </p>
  <p>
    This chapter covers the basic form and syntax for elements, attributes and entities. Parts
    II and III of the book detail how elements and attributes
    <ul>
      <li>Describe kinds of text (such as paragraphs or tables)</li>
      <li>Create an effect on the page (such as changing font style)</li>
      <li>Add images and links to a page</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4>Elements</h4>
  <p>
    Elements are the building blocks of (X)HTML. You use them to describe every piece of text
    on your page. Elements are made up pf tags and the content within those tags. There are two
    main types of elements:
    <ul>
      <li>Elements with content made up of a tag pair and whatever content sits between the opening
        and closing tag in the pair
      </li>
      <li>Elements that insert something into the page using a single tag</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Tag Pairs</i></b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Elements that describe content use a <i>tag pair</i> to mark the beginning and the end of the
    element. Start and end tag pairs look like this:
    &lt;tag&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt;
  </p>
  <p>Content -- such as <i>paragraphs, headings, tables,</i> and <i>lists</i> -- always uses
  a tag pair:
    <ul>
      <li>The start tag (&lt;tag&gt;) tells the browser. "The element begins here."</li>
      <li>The end tag (&lt;/tag&gt;) tells the browser. "The element ends here."</li>
    </ul></p>
  <p>
    The actual content is what occurs between the start tag and end tag. For example, the Red
    Wine Varietals page in Listing 1-1 uses the paragraph element (&lt;p&gt;) to surround the
    text of a paragraph.
  </p>
  <p><i><b>Single Tags</b></i></p>
  <p>Elements that insert something into the page are called
  <i>empty elements</i> (because they enclose no content) and use just a single tag, like this:
  &lt;tag /&gt;</p>
  <p>
    Images and line breakes insert something into the HTML file, so they use one tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    One key difference between XHTML and HTML is that, in XHTML, all empty elements must end
    with slash before the closing greater-than symbol. This is because XHTML is based on XML,
    and the XML rule is that you close empty elements with a slash, like this: &lt;tag/&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    However, to make this kind of markup readable inside older browsers, you must insert a space
    before the closing slash. This space allows older browsers ignore the closing slash (since
    they don't know about XHTML). Newer browsers that understand XHTML ignore the space and
    interpret the tag exactly as intended, which is &lt;tag/&gt; (as per the XML rules).
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML doesn't require a slash with empty elements, but this markup is deprecated. An HTML
    empty element looks like this: &lt;tag&gt;
  </p>
  <p>
    Listing 1-1 uses the image element (&lt;img /&gt;) to include an image on the page:
  </p>
  <p><code>
    &lt;img src="red_grapes.jpg" width="75" height="100" alt="Red Grapes" align="middle"
    hspaceI="5" /&gt;
  </code></p>
  <p>
    The &lt;img /&gt; element references an image. When the browser displays the page, it
    replaces the &lt;img /&gt; element with the file that it points to (it uses an attribute
    to do the pointing, which is shown in the next section). Following the XHTML rule introduced
    earlier, what appears in HTML as &lt;img&gt; appears in XHTML as &lt;img /&gt; (and this
    applies to all single tag elements).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can't make up HTML or XHTML elements. Elements that are legal in (X)HTML are a very
    specific set -- if you use elements that aren't part of the (XHTML) set, every browser ignores
    them. The elements you <i>can</i> use are defined in the HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0 specifications.
  </p>
  <b><i>Nesting</i></b>
  <p>Many page structures combine nested elements. Think of your nested elements as <i>suitcases</i>
    that fit neatly inside one another.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a bulleted list uses two kinds of elements:
    <ul>
      <li>The &lt;ul&gt; element specifies that the list is unordered (bulleted).</li>
      <li>The &lt;li&gt; elements mark each item in the list.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <P>
    When you combine elements by using this method, be sure you close the inside element completely
    before you close the outside element:
    <p>
      <pre><code>
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Barbera&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Brunello&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      </code></pre>
    </p>
  </P>
  <h4>Attributes</h4>
  <p>
    Attributes allow variety in how an element describes content or works. Attributes let you use
    elements differently depending on the circumstances. For example, the &lt;img /&gt; element uses
    the <code>src</code> attribute to specify the location of the image you want to include at a specific spot on your page:
  </p>
  <p><pre><code>
    &lt;img <b>src="red_grapes.jpg"</b> width="75" height="100" alt="Red Grapes"
      align="middle" hspace="5" /&gt;
  </code></pre></p>
  <p>
    In this bit of HTML, the &lt;img /&gt; element itself is a general flag to the browser
    that you want to include an image; the <code>src</code> attribute provides the specifics
    on the image you want to include -- <code>red_grapes.jpg</code> in this instance. Other
    attributes (such as <code>width, height, align,</code> and <code>hspace</code>) provide
    information about how to display the image, and the <code>alt</code> attribute provides
    a text alternative to the image that a text-only browser can display.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chapter 7 describes the &lt;img /&gt; element and its attributes in detail.
  </p>
  <p>
    You include attributes within the start tag of the you want them with -- after the
    element name but before the ending sign, like this:
    <p>
      <pre><code>&lt;tag <b>attribute="value" attribute="value"</b>&gt;</code></pre>
    </p>
  </p>
  <p>
    XML syntax rules decree that attribute values must always appear in quotation marks,
    but you can include the attributes and their values in any order within the start tag
    or within a single tag.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every (X)HTML element has a collection of attributes that can be used with it, and you
    can't mix and match attibutes and elements. Some attributes can take any text as a value
    because the value could be anything, like the location of a image or a page you want to 
    link to. Others have a specific list of values the attribute can take, such as your options
    for aligning text in table cell.
  </p>
  <p>
    The HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 specifications define exactly which attributes you can use with
    any given element and which values (if explicitly defined) each attribute can take.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each chapter in Parts II and III covers which attributes you can use with each (X)HTML
    element. Also, see Appendix A for complete lists of deprecated (X)HTML tags and attributes.
  </p>
  <h4>Entities</h4>
  <p>
    Text makes the Web possible, but it has limitations. <i>Entities</i> are special characters that can display on your Web page.
  </p>
  <p><b><i>Non-ASCII characters</i></b></p>
  <p>
    Basic American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text defines a fairly small
    number of characters. It doesn't include some special characters, such as <i>trademark
    symbols, fractions,</i> and <i>accented characters.</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, the list of white wine varietals in Figure 1-4 include two accented <i>e</i>
     characters and two <i>u</i> characters with umlauts.
  </p>
  <p>
    ASCII text doesn't include either the accented e or the umlauted u, so HTML uses <i>entities</i>
    to represent them instead. The browser replaces the entity with the character it references. Each
    entity begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). The following markup shows the
    entities in bold:
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><code>
      &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Wine Varietals&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;

      &lt;body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;White Varietals&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Chardonnay&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Chenin Blanc&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Fum<b>&eacute;</b> Blanc&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Gew<b>&uuml;</b>rztraminer&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Gr<b>&uuml;</b>ner Veltliner&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Marsanne&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Muscat&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Pinot Blanc&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Pinot Gris&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Reisling&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Sauvignon Blanc&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;S<b>&eacute;</b>millon&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Trebbiano&lt;/li&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;Viognie&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    The entity that represents the &eacute; with the acute accent is <code><b>&amp;eacute;</b></code>, and the entity
    that represents the ummlauted &uuml; is <code><b>&amp;uuml;</b></code>.
  </p>
  <p><b><i>(X)HTML Character Codes</i></b></p>
  <p>
    The encodings for the ISO-Latin-1 character set are supplied by default, and related entities
    (a pointer to a complete table appears in Table 1-1) can be invoked and used without special
    contortions. But using the other encodings mentioned in Table 1-1 requires inclusion of special
    markup to tell the browser it must be ready to interpret Unicode character codes. (Unicode is
    an international standard -- ISO standard 10646, in fact -- that embraces enough character
    codes to handle most unique alphabets, plus plenty of other symbols and nonalphabetic
    characters as well.) This special markup takes the form <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
	    content="text/html"; charset="UTF 8"&gt;</code>; when the value for <code>charset</code>
    is changed to <code>UTF-8</code>, you can reference the common Unicode code charts shown in
    Table 1-1.

  <p><b><i>Tag Characters</i></b></p>
  <p>
    HTML-savvy software assumes that some HTML characters, such as the greater-than and less-than
    signs, are meant to be hidden and not displayed on your finished Web page. The following entities
    display characters that normally are part of the hidden HTML markup:
    <ul>
      <li><b>less-than sign (&lt;):</b> &amp;lt;</li>
      <li><b>greater-than sign (&gt;):</b> &amp;gt;</li>
      <li><b>ampersand (&amp;):</b> &amp;amp;</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The &lt; and &gt; signs are used in markup, but these symbols are <i>instructions</i> to
    <i>the browser</i> and won't show up on the page. If you need these symbols on the Web page,
    include the entities for them in your markup, like this:
    <p>
      <code><pre>
      &lt;p&gt;The paragraph element identifies some text as a paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;<b>&amp;lt;</b>p<b>&amp;gt;</b>This is a paragraph.<b>&amp;lt;</b>/p<b>&amp;gt;</b>&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre></code>
    </p>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the preceding markup, the first line uses <i>tags</i> to describe a paragraph, and the
    second line shows how <i>entities</i> describe the &lt; and &gt; symbols.
  </p>
  <h4>Parts Is Parts: What Web Pages Are Made Of</h4>
  <p>
    <i>Comments</i> include text in (X)HTML files that isn't displayed in the final page. Each
    comment is identified with two special sequences of markup characters:
    <ul>
      <li>Begin each comment with the string &lt;!--</li>
      <li>End each comment with the string --&gt;</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the following code, comments explain how each markup element functions and where it fits
    into the HTML markup hierarchy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Elements are organized into structure:
    <ul>
      <li>Some elements can occur only inside other elements.</li>
      <li>Some elements are required for a well-structured (X)HTML document.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><code>
      &lt;html&gt; &lt;!-- This tag should always occur at or near the beginning of any 
                           well-formed HTML document --&gt;
      &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- The <i>head</i> element supplies information to label the whole HTML
                           document --&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;Wine Varietals&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!-- The text in the <i>title</i> element
                           in the title bar of the browser window when the page is viewed --&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt; &lt;!-- Closes the <i>head</i> element --&gt;

      &lt;body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"&gt; &lt;!-- The content that appears on any Web page appears or
                           is invoked from inside the <i>body</i> element --&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;White Varietals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;!-- Heading elements start with the letter
                           <i>h</i> followed by aa number from <i>1</i> to <i>6</i> to indicate
                           hierarchy. This is a level 2 heading, <i>h2</i>. --&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt; &lt;!-- This is an unordered list element, <i>ul</i>, which produces a
                           bulleted list of list items, <i>li</i>. --&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Chardonnay&lt;/li&gt; &lt;!-- A whole bunch of individual list items --&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Chenin Blanc&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Fum&eacute; Blanc&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Gew&uuml;rztraminer&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Gr&uuml;ner Veltriner&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;!-- End of the unordered / bulleted list --&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt; &lt;!-- End of the body section --&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt; &lt;!-- End of the HTML document --&gt;
    </code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>
    The precending document is broken into a <code>head</code> and a <code>body</code>. Within each
    section, certain kinds of elements appear. Many combinations are possible, and that's what you
    see throughout this book!
  </p>
  <h4>Organizing HTML Text</h4>
  <p>
    Beyond the division into head and body sections, text can be organized in plenty of ways
    in HTML documents.
  </p>
  <p><b><i>Document Heads</i></b></p>
  <p>
    Inside the <code>head</code> section, you can define all kinds of labels and information
    besides a title, primarily to describe the document that follows, such as the character
    sets used, scripts to be invoked, and the style information. The body section is where
    real content lives and most (X)HTML elements appear.
  </p>
  <p><b><i>Document Headings</i></b></p>
  <p>
    <i>Headings</i> (denoted using elements <code>h1</code> through <code>h6</code>) are
    different from the HTML document head. Individual headings structure the text that follows
    them, whereas the <code>head</code> identifies or describes the whole document.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Wine Varietals example, the <code>h2</code> element titles a list of grape varieties.
  </p>
  <p><b><i>Paragraphs and More</i></b></p>
  <p>
    When you want running text on a Web page, the paragraph element, <code>p</code> (which
    includes the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; tags), breaks text into paragraphs. You can also;
    <ul>
      <li>Force line breaks by using the break element &lt;br /&gt;.</li>
      <li>Create horizontal rules (lines) by using the &lt;hr /&gt; element.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML also includes all kinds of ways to emphasize or identify text inside paragraphs;
    Parts II and III of this book show them.
  </p>
  <p><b><i>Lists</i></b></p>
  <p>
  HTML permits easy definition of unordered or bulleted lists. Various mechanisms to create
  other kinds of lists, including numbered lists, are also available. Lists can be nested
  within lists to create as many levels of hierarchy as your list might need (perhaps when 
  outlining a complex subject or modeling a table of contents with several heading levels 
  you want to represent). Chapter 5 covers creating lists in more detail.
  </p>
  <p><b><i>Tables</i></b></p>
  <p>
    HTML includes markup for defining tables. Chapter 11 covers tables. Structure is part of
    how markup works, so whitin the definition of a table, you can
    <ul>
      <li>Distinguish between column heads and table data</li>
      <li>Manage how rows and columns are laid out</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h4>Images in HTML Documents</h4>
  <p>
    Adding an image to any HTML document is easy. Careful and well-planned use of images adds
    a lot to Web pages. Chapter 7 shows how to grab images from files. Chapter 9 shows how to
    use complex markup to position and flow text around graphics. You also discover how to 
    select and use interesting and compelling images to add interest and information to your 
    Web pages.
  </p>
  <h4>Links and Navigation Tools</h4>
  <p>
    A Web page's structure should help visitors find their way around collections of Web pages,
    look for (and hopefully, find) items of interest, and get where they most want to go quickly
    and easily. Links provide the mechanism to bring people into your Web pages, so Chapter 6
    shows how to
    <ul>
      <li>Reference external items or resources</li>
      <li>Jump from one page to the next</li>
      <li>Jump around inside a page</li>
      <li>
	Add structure and organization to your pages<br />
        The importance of structure and organization goes up as the amount of information
        that you want to represent to your visitors goes up.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Navigation tools,</i> (which establish standard mechanisms and tools for moving around
    inside a Web site) provide ways to create and present your Web page (and site) structure to
    visitors and mechanisms for users to grab and use organized menus of choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you add everything up, your result should be a well-organized set of information and
    images that's easy to understand, use, and navigate.
